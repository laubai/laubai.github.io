*Based on the song by Garmarna.*




Tala’s maids return to her chamber when the sun is high. She has already swept the night’s salt and the pale, withered rushes into the hall. The maids bring fresh, fragrant reeds for her doorway and hot, sweet xocolatl with seed cakes. They know better than to ask her how she slept.

She dozes in her solar like a woman thrice her age until Corozon brings in his ledgers. Together, they review the stores and the latest note from Karstoi, and he leaves her alone to write a response.

She writes: She hopes one day she will be able to accept his kind and generous offers. She begs for patience while her heart heals the loss of her husband.

She wishes his progress would bring him to Holgerroc, that this game might finally end.

She dines with Corozon and her husband’s chosen men before the sun sets. They do not pretend to merriness, as they escort her to her chambers, and help her to make sure her door is barred. Her maids watch, guilty, afraid, as they lock her in.

She lines the door and the casement with salt, shuttering the windows that a fell wind might not disturb the charms. She lights the candles around her bed and draws a new line of salt around it.

She wraps herself in the covers and waits for her breath to smoke. One by one, the candles gutter. In the darkness, she hears the clink of her husband’s mailed boots, and the iron shoe nailed to her door begins to glow.

He’s knocking. He wants to come in.
