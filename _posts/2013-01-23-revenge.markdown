Carefully, Darius takes his uncle’s knife from the fire and applies it to the ruined cartilage of his left ear. His right hand holds his left in place as slick fingers jump and shudder.

His uncle’s knife. The gifted harness. Something clicks as he returns the blade to the flame, and the agony recedes to a throb.

They won’t come back for him. And his elfin pride is only a danger to him, now.

When the right ear matches its mate, he cleans his shaking hands and stares into the fire.

In his heart, he knows what he must do.
